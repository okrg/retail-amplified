<p>On the <strong>Home</strong> page there are 2 important areas.</p>
<p>The first is the <strong>Announcement</strong>, here is where the administrators of the system can post general announcements that are either targeted for corporate employees/consultants, or for outside vendors.</p>
<p>Below that is the <strong>Project List</strong>. Here you will find a list of available projects, with a distinct separation between Charlotte Russe stores, and Rampage stores. All corporate employees and consultants can see all projects, however outside vendors can only see projects which they are associated with. Association with a particular project is made by an adminstrator. If you are a vendor, and you are not able to find a project, it may be because an administrator has not yet associated you with that project. </p>

<p>When you click on a project, you are taken to the <strong>Project</strong> page, which contains 3 distinct areas of project information and documents:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Project Summary</strong> is where you will find the basic information about a project. Soon, this will contain all the same information as the project directory doc. </li>
  <li><strong>Project Files</strong> is where all project files and documents are stored. Folders indicate specific distributions of files such as Delta revisions and Final bid sets. General project files are shown beneath the folders. This is very similar to Windows Explorer. To access a file distribution, simply click on the folder name. If  file comments are available, they will be shown in abbreviated form, hover your mouse curser over the comment for a second to see the full comment. </li>
  <li><strong>Project Photos</strong> is where administrators will upload project photos. Clicking on an album name will take you to a page of thumbnail files, which can be clicked to open the full size photo in a new window. </li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you click on a folder in the project page, you are taken to a new page which lists the files in the folder in alphanumerical sorting order. To download a file, simply click on its name you will then be given the download dialog by your web browser. It is up to you wether you want to save it to your computer and open it, or open it directly off the site (as a temporary file). Only site administrators can alter files.</p>

<p>Individually clicking on file names is cumbersome when working with folders that have several files, such as this one. To make things easier, you have the option to download the entire folder as one large zip file. This is done dynamically. What that means, is that there are never ZIP files residing on the server. The ZIP files you download are created at the time that you click for them, therefore it takes a few seconds to prepare the file for you. Additionally, the web browser has no way of knowing how large the file is, so you will not automatically know how long  the download is. You can get a good idea of how large the file may be by averaging out the file sizes with the number of files. This is not a total solution, I admit, and is one of the inconsistencies we must cope with when using a web browser for such dynamic functions. </p>
